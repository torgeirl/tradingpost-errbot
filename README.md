![Docker](https://github.com/torgeirl/tradingpost-errbot/workflows/Docker/badge.svg)

## Overview
A simple Magic: the Gathering bot, implemented as an Errbot plugin and deployed with Kubernetes.

## Deployment (kubectl)
Save your bot's Slack token and the username(s) of the bot's admin(s) as secrets:
  - `$ kubectl create secret generic tradingpost-config --from-literal='errbot-token=xoxb-4426949411-aEM7...' --from-literal='errbot-admins=@gbin'`

Deploy the bot:
  - `$ kubectl create -f deploy/tradingpost-errbot.yaml`

You can see the bot's pod by listing pods:
  - `$ kubectl get pods`

The Errbot logs are available from the Kubernetes:
  - `$ kubectl logs tradingpost-deployment-<pod-identifier>`

Recreate the deployment to update the bot to the latest version:
  - `$ kubectl delete -f deploy/tradingpost-errbot.yaml`
  - `$ kubectl create -f deploy/tradingpost-errbot.yaml`

## History and credits
  - Tradingpost was first created in 2016 as [tradingpost-beepboop](https://github.com/torgeirl/tradingpost-beepboop), a [BeepBoop](https://beepboophq.com/docs/article/overview)-hostable Slack bot. The inspiration to make it came from seeing Filip SÃ¶derholm's [cardfetcher bot](https://github.com/fiso/cardfetcher) in action, and part of his code was re-used while making Tradingpost.

  - Tradingpost was ported from BeepBoop to [Errbot](https://github.com/errbotio/errbot) in November 2017. [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) was adapted as the backend around the same time.

  - [The Sutcliffe canvas](src/assets/sutcliffe-canvas.png) is [Athena's creation](https://twitter.com/_Elantris_/status/1103775781543530496) while [Anthony Martin inspired the bot command](https://twitter.com/Martony101/status/1103858795371851777).
