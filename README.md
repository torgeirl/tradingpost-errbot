## Credits
  - tradingpost-errbot is a port of [tradingpost-beepboop](https://github.com/torgeirl/tradingpost-beepboop), a [BeepBoop](https://beepboophq.com/docs/article/overview)-hostable Slack bot. I got the inspiration to make tradingpost-beepboop after seeing Filip SÃ¶derholm's [cardfetcher bot](https://github.com/fiso/cardfetcher) in action, and I have re-used part of his code while making Tradingpost.

  - The Sutcliffe canvas itself is [Athena's creation](https://twitter.com/_Elantris_/status/1103775781543530496) while [Anthony Martin inspired the bot command](https://twitter.com/Martony101/status/1103858795371851777).
